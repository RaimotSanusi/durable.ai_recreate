	<p
	class="note">Kevin Ellis is Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University working on artificial intelligence and program synthesis, with the goal of better combining reasoning and learning. His research is motivated by the goals of building machine learning systems that generalize strongly (extrapolating rather than interpolating); while requiring less data (greater sample efficiency); and which acquire interpretable knowledge that humans can understand and build on. He draws on ideas and techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, programming languages, and cognitive science. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT.</p>
